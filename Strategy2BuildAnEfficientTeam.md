What strategy do you employ for building an efficient work team ?

Building an efficient team starts with hiring the right mix of people — not just based on technical skill, but mindset, adaptability, and collaboration. At HPE and GE Healthcare, I focused on creating balanced teams with a mix of strengths: strong coders, good system thinkers, and people who could bridge engineering and product.

Once the team is formed, my strategy is based on three pillars:**

1. Clarity – Every team member should know the ‘why’ behind their work. I make sure goals, ownership, and expectations are clearly defined. I often use OKRs at the team level to align priorities across engineering and product.

2. Autonomy with accountability – I give teams space to make decisions, experiment, and solve problems their way, while ensuring we have regular checkpoints and measurable outcomes. This builds trust and speeds up execution.

3. Continuous growth – I encourage learning through mentoring, pairing, design reviews, and retros. For example, at GE, I set up internal tech talks and weekly architecture deep-dives to raise the bar across the team.

I also pay attention to team health — celebrating small wins, ensuring psychological safety, and resolving blockers quickly. An efficient team is not just fast — it’s one that is aligned, motivated, and improving continuously. That’s the kind of culture I build and lead."**
