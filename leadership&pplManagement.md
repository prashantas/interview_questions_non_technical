Leadership & People Management

*************************************************************************************************
Tell me about your leadership style. How do you adapt it to different team members?

ANS: My leadership style is situational but rooted in three constants — clarity, empowerment, and accountability.

I believe in setting a clear vision and outcomes, then giving teams the autonomy to decide how to get there. At HPE, leading multiple product owners, I used OKRs to align everyone on priorities, but I let each owner manage their backlog in the way that worked best for their engineering squad.

I adapt based on the individual:

For experienced, self-driven engineers or leads, I take a coaching style — offering guidance, removing blockers, and giving space for innovation.

For newer team members or those in unfamiliar domains, I use a hands-on, directive approach initially — pairing them with mentors, reviewing plans closely, and gradually increasing their independence.

At GE Healthcare, I had both profiles in the same team — senior AI engineers who thrived on autonomy and junior developers transitioning from monolithic to microservices. Adjusting my style allowed both groups to perform at their best while still moving as one team toward the product goals.

For me, adapting isn’t about lowering standards — it’s about meeting people where they are, so they can grow, contribute, and stay engaged."**

How do you build, scale, and retain high-performing engineering teams??????????????????????????????????????????????????????

ANS: I approach this in three phases — building the right foundation, scaling effectively, and retaining talent by creating an environment where people thrive.

1. Build – I start with hiring for mindset as much as skill. Across roles at HPE, GE Healthcare, and startups, I’ve looked for engineers who are adaptable, collaborative, and customer-focused. I balance teams with a mix of deep technical specialists and strong system thinkers, ensuring diversity in thought and background.

2. Scale – At HPE, as I grew a team of product owners supporting multiple engineering squads, I implemented clear OKRs, empowered leads to make decisions, and standardized delivery practices like Agile ceremonies and DevSecOps pipelines. This allowed us to scale without losing quality, and delivery velocity improved measurably.

3. Retain – I focus on growth and engagement. I’ve run mentorship programs, architecture deep-dives, and tech talks to keep learning active. I ensure achievements are recognized and that engineers see the impact of their work on customers and the business. At GE Healthcare, this approach reduced attrition and helped build a strong internal talent pipeline.

At J.P. Morgan, with the scale and complexity of your systems, I’d apply the same principles — building balanced teams, enabling them to operate autonomously with clear goals, and creating a culture of trust, mastery, and purpose."**
