Leadership & People Management

*************************************************************************************************
Tell me about your leadership style. How do you adapt it to different team members?

ANS: My leadership style is situational but rooted in three constants — clarity, empowerment, and accountability.

I believe in setting a clear vision and outcomes, then giving teams the autonomy to decide how to get there. At HPE, leading multiple product owners, I used OKRs to align everyone on priorities, but I let each owner manage their backlog in the way that worked best for their engineering squad.

I adapt based on the individual:

For experienced, self-driven engineers or leads, I take a coaching style — offering guidance, removing blockers, and giving space for innovation.

For newer team members or those in unfamiliar domains, I use a hands-on, directive approach initially — pairing them with mentors, reviewing plans closely, and gradually increasing their independence.

At GE Healthcare, I had both profiles in the same team — senior AI engineers who thrived on autonomy and junior developers transitioning from monolithic to microservices. Adjusting my style allowed both groups to perform at their best while still moving as one team toward the product goals.

For me, adapting isn’t about lowering standards — it’s about meeting people where they are, so they can grow, contribute, and stay engaged."**

How do you build, scale, and retain high-performing engineering teams??????????????????????????????????????????????????????

ANS: I approach this in three phases — building the right foundation, scaling effectively, and retaining talent by creating an environment where people thrive.

1. Build – I start with hiring for mindset as much as skill. Across roles at HPE, GE Healthcare, and startups, I’ve looked for engineers who are adaptable, collaborative, and customer-focused. I balance teams with a mix of deep technical specialists and strong system thinkers, ensuring diversity in thought and background.

2. Scale – At HPE, as I grew a team of product owners supporting multiple engineering squads, I implemented clear OKRs, empowered leads to make decisions, and standardized delivery practices like Agile ceremonies and DevSecOps pipelines. This allowed us to scale without losing quality, and delivery velocity improved measurably.

3. Retain – I focus on growth and engagement. I’ve run mentorship programs, architecture deep-dives, and tech talks to keep learning active. I ensure achievements are recognized and that engineers see the impact of their work on customers and the business. At GE Healthcare, this approach reduced attrition and helped build a strong internal talent pipeline.

At J.P. Morgan, with the scale and complexity of your systems, I’d apply the same principles — building balanced teams, enabling them to operate autonomously with clear goals, and creating a culture of trust, mastery, and purpose."**

Give me an example of how you have mentored or developed leaders under you.

ANSWER::At HPE, I led a team of five product owners who each supported different engineering squads. One of them was a strong technologist but relatively new to stakeholder management and backlog prioritization.

I started by working closely with them in the first few sprints — joining their stakeholder calls, helping them break down large epics into deliverable stories, and showing how to align backlog priorities to business objectives.

As their confidence grew, I gradually stepped back, letting them lead stakeholder discussions and make trade-off decisions. I still provided a safe space to review challenges weekly, but the ownership shifted to them.

Within six months, they had transformed into a confident product owner, trusted by both engineering and business teams. They eventually took on a larger, cross-squad program.

For me, mentoring is about giving people the right mix of support, exposure, and autonomy — so they grow into leaders who can operate independently, but still align with the organization’s vision. I believe that’s essential at a place like J.P. Morgan, where leadership at every level is key to scaling impact."**

How do you handle underperformance in senior engineers or leads?

ANSWER::With senior engineers or leads, I start by assuming there’s a root cause that can be addressed — whether it’s clarity, capability, or motivation. My approach is structured but empathetic.

First, I have a direct one-on-one conversation to understand their perspective — sometimes it’s a misalignment on expectations, sometimes personal challenges, and occasionally skill gaps. At GE Healthcare, I had a senior engineer whose deliverables were slipping despite their strong technical background.

We reviewed expectations together, identified that the challenge was adapting to our new microservices and CI/CD model, and I paired them with a lead who was strong in that area. I also set short-term, measurable goals with weekly check-ins to track progress.

In most cases, providing targeted support and clear success metrics leads to improvement. If performance doesn’t improve despite these efforts, I make the tough call — either moving them to a role better suited to their strengths or initiating a formal performance process.

The key is to address the issue early, keep communication transparent, and ensure the rest of the team sees that we maintain a high performance bar while supporting people in getting there."**

What’s your approach to ensuring diversity and inclusion in engineering hiring?

ANSWER:: For me, diversity and inclusion in hiring is about two things — widening the talent pipeline and removing bias from the process.

On the pipeline side, I work with recruiters to ensure we’re sourcing from diverse channels — universities, return-to-work programs, community tech groups, and women-in-tech networks. At HPE, this approach helped us bring in experienced women engineers returning from career breaks into product and architecture roles.

In the process itself, I use structured interview panels with diverse representation and standardized evaluation rubrics. This ensures candidates are assessed on skills and potential, not just cultural similarity to the existing team.

Inclusion doesn’t stop at hiring — I make sure new hires have equal access to impactful projects, mentorship, and career advancement opportunities. At GE Healthcare, for example, I paired junior hires from underrepresented backgrounds with senior mentors and rotated them into high-visibility work, which improved retention and engagement.

I believe diversity drives better problem-solving, and inclusion ensures people bring their full selves to work. At J.P. Morgan’s scale, both are critical to building resilient, high-performing engineering teams."**

How do you balance speed of delivery with quality in a high-pressure environment?

ANSWER:: I see speed and quality not as trade-offs but as outcomes of the right process and discipline. In high-pressure situations, my approach is to create a delivery framework that protects quality while enabling fast execution.

First, I work with stakeholders to clarify the true priority — what must go live now and what can follow in phases. At HPE, during a time-critical MLOps release, we adopted an incremental delivery plan — launching the core capability early while continuing work on secondary features.

Second, I ensure we have strong engineering practices baked in — automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and peer reviews. At GE Healthcare, this allowed us to deploy critical updates to our AI inferencing platform within hours, without introducing defects that could impact patient safety.

Finally, I keep a close loop between business, product, and engineering during the sprint — so if trade-offs arise, we make them with full visibility of the impact. This way, we maintain velocity without accruing hidden technical debt.

My principle is: Deliver fast, but never so fast that you have to slow down later to fix avoidable issues. In banking, where stability and trust are paramount, that discipline is non-negotiable."**

How do you manage distributed or global teams effectively?

ANSWER:: Managing distributed teams is about creating alignment, enabling effective communication, and building trust despite distance and time zones.

First, I ensure there’s a shared vision and clarity on ownership. At HPE, my product owner team supported engineering squads spread across India, the US, and Europe. We used OKRs and a shared delivery dashboard so everyone, regardless of location, had the same view of goals and progress.

Second, I tailor communication to the team’s geography — combining asynchronous updates (Confluence pages, Slack channels, Jira boards) with regular overlap meetings for high-touch discussions. This prevents decision bottlenecks in one region and keeps momentum going around the clock.

Third, I invest in relationship building — even virtual coffee chats, recognition in team meetings, and rotating meeting times to share the inconvenience fairly. At GE Healthcare, this helped create a “one team” culture, reducing friction between US and India teams during critical delivery phases.

Finally, I make sure that remote teams have equal access to leadership, high-impact work, and decision-making forums, so they feel empowered and not like secondary contributors. This inclusion is what drives engagement and performance in a global setup."**
