OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. It is a goal-setting framework used by individuals, teams, and organizations to define and track progress toward achieving specific, measurable goals. Essentially, it's a method for setting ambitious goals (the Objectives) and then defining measurable outcomes (Key Results) that indicate progress toward those goals. 

Here's a breakdown:

Objectives:
These are qualitative, aspirational goals that describe what you want to achieve. They should be clear, concise, and inspiring.

Key Results:

These are measurable outcomes that demonstrate progress toward the objective. They should be specific, time-bound, and quantifiable. 

For example, an objective might be "Increase brand awareness," while key results could be "Increase website traffic by 20%" and "Increase social media followers by 10%." 

OKRs are typically set for a specific period, such as a quarter or a year, and are used to align efforts and track progress towards achieving those goals. They are a popular management strategy for ensuring focus and engagement around key objectives.
