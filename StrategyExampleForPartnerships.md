Help me answer interview question for director of software engineering at JP Morgan India
"Provide examples of strategies you’ve developed for partnerships"

In my leadership roles across HPE, GE Healthcare, and earlier at Adobe, I’ve often worked on engineering programs that required close partnerships — both internal and external. Let me share two examples where I developed partnership strategies that delivered strong outcomes."

1. Internal Partnership Strategy (HPE):
At HPE, I led a cross-functional effort for an MLOps platform release. Success depended not just on engineering, but on alignment with security, product management, customer onboarding, and marketing.
To drive this, I created a “platform working group” model where stakeholders from each function had clear roles, shared OKRs (Objective & Key Results), and participated in sprint reviews. This transparency reduced friction, improved delivery speed, and ensured a smooth go-to-market. It also helped our customer adoption grow from zero to active users in less than a month post-launch.

2. External Tech Partnership (GE Healthcare):
At GE Healthcare, we were building AI inferencing services and needed reliable, low-latency performance on edge devices. I proposed and drove a technical partnership with NVIDIA to leverage TensorRT.
We defined a joint benchmark plan, brought in NVIDIA’s field engineers early, and integrated their feedback into our deployment pipeline. This not only reduced latency by over 40%, but also opened up a co-marketing opportunity where our architecture was showcased in a joint webinar.

In both cases, the key was to build mutual value, define shared success metrics, and maintain open, regular communication. I believe these principles apply whether it’s a vendor, internal team, or strategic client — and I’d bring the same approach at J.P. Morgan."**
