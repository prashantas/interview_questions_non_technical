Interview Question: "How do you do stakeholder management / your approach to stakeholder management?"



"For me, stakeholder management is about building trust through transparency, alignment, and consistent delivery. My approach has three key parts:

1. Understanding and aligning on priorities – At the start of any initiative, I invest time to understand the stakeholder’s objectives, success metrics, and constraints. For example, at HPE, while leading the MLOps platform release, I worked closely with product, sales, compliance, and engineering to ensure we all agreed on a shared definition of success before development began.

2. Continuous and transparent communication – I keep stakeholders engaged through regular touchpoints — sprint reviews, progress dashboards, and risk logs. I make it a point to surface risks early rather than when they become blockers. This builds confidence that we are in control even when challenges arise.

3. Balancing competing needs and driving win-win outcomes – Often stakeholders have conflicting priorities. In those cases, I use data, trade-off discussions, and sometimes incremental delivery to ensure that the most critical needs are met first without derailing other commitments. At GE Healthcare, this approach helped us align product release dates with both engineering readiness and regulatory deadlines without compromising quality.

I also focus on building long-term relationships — so that even beyond the project, stakeholders see me as a trusted partner who understands both the technical and business sides. That’s the mindset I’d bring to J.P. Morgan — proactive alignment, transparent execution, and building trust through results."**
