Innovation & Continuous Improvement

##################################################################################################

What does innovation mean to you, and how have you driven it in your teams?

ANSWER:: To me, innovation is about solving real problems in new and better ways — not chasing novelty for its own sake. True innovation delivers measurable value to customers, improves efficiency, or opens new business opportunities.

At HPE, while leading the MLOps platform release, customer feedback revealed that onboarding was taking too long and delaying adoption. Instead of just improving documentation, we built an automated onboarding sandbox where clients could test integrations with dummy data before full production approval.

This required collaboration between engineering, product, and compliance to simulate security and data-handling rules in a safe environment. The result was a 30% reduction in onboarding time and faster customer adoption.

At GE Healthcare, I also drove innovation by introducing NVIDIA TensorRT into our AI inferencing pipeline to significantly reduce latency. This wasn’t just a tech improvement — it directly improved the responsiveness of diagnostic tools, impacting patient care.

For me, the key to driving innovation is listening closely to end-user pain points, empowering teams to experiment within safe boundaries, and ensuring we measure impact so that new ideas translate into real-world value."**
