Innovation & Continuous Improvement

##################################################################################################

What does innovation mean to you, and how have you driven it in your teams?

ANSWER:: To me, innovation is about solving real problems in new and better ways — not just using the latest technology for its own sake, but using it purposefully to deliver measurable value to customers and the business.. True innovation delivers measurable value to customers, improves efficiency, or opens new business opportunities.

At HPE, while leading the MLOps platform release, customer feedback revealed that onboarding was taking too long and delaying adoption. Instead of just improving documentation, we built an automated onboarding sandbox where clients could test integrations with dummy data before full production approval.

This required collaboration between engineering, product, and compliance to simulate security and data-handling rules in a safe environment. The result was a 30% reduction in onboarding time and faster customer adoption.

At GE Healthcare, I also drove innovation by introducing NVIDIA TensorRT into our AI inferencing pipeline to significantly reduce latency. This wasn’t just a tech improvement — it directly improved the responsiveness of diagnostic tools, impacting patient care.

For me, the key to driving innovation is listening closely to end-user pain points, empowering teams to experiment within safe boundaries, and ensuring we measure impact so that new ideas translate into real-world value."**

Give an example of how you’ve used customer insights to shape a technical solution.

ANSWER:: At HPE, while working on our MLOps platform, we noticed from early customer feedback sessions and onboarding metrics that clients were struggling with the initial integration process. Many cited delays due to lengthy approval cycles and uncertainty about API behavior.

Instead of addressing this only through better documentation, I worked with engineering, security, and compliance teams to design an automated onboarding sandbox. This environment allowed customers to test their API integrations with dummy data under simulated compliance rules, without needing full production credentials.

From a technical perspective, we containerized the sandbox services, ensured they mirrored production APIs, and built automated validation scripts to give immediate feedback on integration success or issues.

The result was a 30% reduction in onboarding time, fewer support escalations, and faster time-to-value for customers. More importantly, it improved customer confidence in our platform before they even went live.

For me, this reinforced that customer insights are not just ‘feedback’ — they’re a strategic input into technical design, especially when you want adoption and trust to scale quickly."**

How do you create a culture of experimentation without risking stability?

ANSWER::I believe experimentation and stability can coexist if you create the right guardrails. My approach is to separate the space to innovate from the systems that must always be reliable.

First, I encourage teams to experiment in controlled, isolated environments — sandboxes, feature branches, or staging systems — that mirror production but are completely decoupled from live customer data. At HPE, we did this while developing the automated onboarding sandbox for our MLOps platform, allowing us to try new API flows without touching production services.

Second, I set clear criteria for moving an experiment into production — code reviews, automated test coverage thresholds, security scans, and stakeholder sign-off. This ensures that only validated, safe changes go live.

Third, I use feature toggles and canary releases so that even when we roll out new capabilities, we can control exposure, monitor impact, and roll back quickly if needed. At GE Healthcare, this approach allowed us to integrate NVIDIA TensorRT optimizations into our AI pipeline gradually, avoiding disruption to live diagnostic workloads.

The key is to make experimentation a habit, but one that runs inside a safety framework — so we encourage creativity while preserving the trust and stability that customers expect, especially in regulated industries like banking."**

What new technologies or trends do you believe will shape the future of banking?

ANSWER::I see four main technology trends that will shape the future of banking — all of which align with J.P. Morgan’s strategic direction.

1. AI and Machine Learning at scale – From personalized financial advice to fraud detection and predictive risk scoring, AI will move from point solutions to being embedded in every customer and operational journey. The differentiator will be responsible AI — explainable, ethical, and compliant with global regulations.

2. Real-time data platforms – With customers expecting instant payments, settlements, and insights, event-driven architectures and real-time analytics will become core to banking infrastructure. Technologies like Kafka, Flink, and low-latency data meshes will be key.

3. Cloud and Hybrid Platforms – Cloud-native development will accelerate innovation cycles and resilience, but hybrid models will dominate in regulated banking, balancing agility with compliance.

4. Embedded and API-led Banking – Banks will increasingly become platforms, offering Banking-as-a-Service and integrating seamlessly into partner ecosystems through secure, high-performance APIs.

In parallel, cybersecurity, zero-trust architectures, and quantum-safe encryption will be foundational to protect these innovations.

For me, the winning banks will be the ones that combine these technologies with operational discipline, delivering speed and personalization without compromising trust."**
