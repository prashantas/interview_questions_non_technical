Tell me about a time when a project was going off track — how did you recover it?

ANSWER:: At GE Healthcare, I was leading the delivery of an AI inferencing solution for medical imaging, with multiple microservices running on Kubernetes. Midway through, we discovered integration complexity with hospital PACS systems was far greater than expected, and timelines were slipping.

My first step was to stop the bleed — I paused new feature development to focus the team on solving the integration blockers. I brought in domain experts from the PACS vendor, organized joint working sessions, and created a clear defect triage system to prioritize fixes.

Next, I re-sequenced deliverables so other parts of the system — like the inference optimization pipeline and monitoring dashboards — could continue in parallel without waiting on the integration fix. This kept momentum and stakeholder confidence.

I also increased the frequency of updates to stakeholders from bi-weekly to twice a week, ensuring full transparency and quick decision-making on trade-offs.

As a result, we delivered the core solution on the original go-live date, with the remaining non-critical features rolled out in the next sprint. The recovery worked because we acted early, involved the right experts, and kept the business and technical teams aligned on the adjusted plan."**

Describe a time when you had to deliver a critical project with tight timelines and resource constraints.

ANSWER :: At HPE, I led the delivery of an MLOps platform feature set that was tied to a major customer commitment with a fixed launch date. We had only 10 weeks, limited engineering capacity, and dependencies on multiple teams spread across regions.

I started by prioritizing ruthlessly — working with product management to define the MVP that would still deliver customer value while deferring non-critical features to later releases.

I then restructured the team workflow — forming a cross-functional ‘tiger team’ from product owners, engineering leads, and QA, so that decision-making could happen daily instead of through long approval chains.

To optimize the limited engineering bandwidth, we used parallel work streams — one focused on feature development, the other on automation and integration testing — so we could validate as we built.

I also ensured early stakeholder alignment by setting twice-a-week status calls, sharing a live dashboard, and getting immediate buy-in on scope trade-offs.

We launched on time with the agreed MVP, onboarded the customer within days, and then rolled out the deferred features over the following sprints. The key to success was focusing on the must-haves, compressing decision cycles, and creating a high-collaboration environment."**

Give an example of a conflict within your leadership team and how you resolved it.

ANSWER:: At HPE, during the rollout of our MLOps platform, two of my product owners had a conflict over backlog prioritization. One was focused on delivering a customer-facing feature to meet a sales commitment, while the other was pushing for technical debt reduction to stabilize the platform. Both were valid priorities, but their disagreement was creating friction and slowing decisions for their engineering squads.

I first brought them together in a structured discussion to surface the underlying concerns — understanding that one was driven by immediate business impact, the other by long-term platform health.

I reframed the discussion using data:

Showed the revenue risk of delaying the customer feature

Demonstrated the operational risk metrics if technical debt continued to accumulate

With the facts on the table, we agreed on a compromise plan — delivering the high-priority customer feature in the current sprint while allocating a fixed percentage of the sprint capacity to the most critical technical debt items.

I also set up a recurring joint planning session for these product owners so that priorities could be discussed early, before they escalated into conflicts.

The outcome was positive: the feature shipped on time, key technical debt was addressed, and the relationship between the two leaders improved because they felt heard and respected.

For me, resolving leadership conflicts is about listening to both sides, making the trade-offs transparent, and co-creating a solution that serves the larger business goal."**

What’s the hardest decision you’ve had to make as a leader, and what was the outcome?

ANSWER: One of the hardest decisions I’ve made was at GE Healthcare during a critical release of our AI inferencing platform. Late in the development cycle, security testing revealed a potential vulnerability in one of the open-source components we were using. Fixing it would require rework that could delay our committed launch date by three weeks — a delay that would disappoint customers and impact revenue targets.

I gathered my engineering, product, and compliance leads to assess the risk. While the likelihood of exploitation was low, the impact in a healthcare context could be severe, both legally and in terms of patient safety.

After weighing the options, I decided to delay the launch and fix the issue, even though it meant having tough conversations with sales and senior leadership. We were transparent with our customers, explaining that the delay was to ensure the highest level of security and compliance.

The outcome was that the fix was implemented, the platform launched three weeks later, and customers appreciated our integrity and commitment to safety. In the long run, this decision strengthened trust with both customers and internal stakeholders.

For me, it reinforced that as a leader, the hardest decisions often involve choosing the long-term health of the product and reputation over short-term wins — especially in industries where trust is non-negotiable, like healthcare and banking."**

How do you ensure transparency and trust between engineering, product, and business?

ANSWER:: For me, transparency and trust come from alignment on goals, open communication, and consistent delivery on commitments.

First, I ensure there’s a shared understanding of priorities and success metrics across all functions. At HPE, when leading MLOps platform delivery, I brought engineering, product, and business together at the start of each quarter to align OKRs and define what success looked like — from customer adoption targets to technical readiness.

Second, I keep progress and risks visible to all stakeholders. We used a shared dashboard that tracked feature progress, defect counts, and delivery timelines, updated in real time from Jira. This meant there were no surprises — everyone could see where we stood at any point.

Third, I address risks early rather than letting them grow. If a dependency or technical blocker threatens a delivery date, I flag it immediately with impact and options, so business leaders can make informed trade-offs. This was particularly important at GE Healthcare, where regulatory dependencies often came late in the cycle.

Finally, I make sure credit is shared across functions. Recognizing engineering in business forums and highlighting product/business contributions in engineering all-hands fosters mutual respect.

The result is a culture where teams feel they’re working toward a shared goal, not competing agendas — which is essential in complex, high-stakes environments like banking."**
