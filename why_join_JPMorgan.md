Help me answer the following intrview question in very simple words for a director of software engineering role asked at JP Morgan India. on my background , I have 16 years of experience in various organization like samsung, adobe, GE healhcare, couple of fast paced startups in various role like developers , tech lead, architect besides my current job as a senior technical product manager at HPE
"Why do you want to join us ?"


With 16 years of experience across companies like Samsung, Adobe, GE Healthcare, startups, and now HPE, I’ve seen how great products and platforms are built — from early-stage ideas to large-scale enterprise solutions.

I want to join J.P. Morgan because it’s one of the few places where technology is used at real scale and still evolving fast. I’m excited by how you're modernizing platforms, using cloud, data, and automation — and doing it with a long-term view and real impact.

Also, your India tech teams are no longer just support; they’re driving product and platform thinking. I’d love to bring both my engineering and product experience here — to lead strong teams, build smart systems, and help shape things that matter to customers and the business.
