Based on the above attached resume, help me answer a interview question in JPMorgan India for a director of software engineering position 
"Tell me about your experience"

I have around 16 years of experience in software engineering and product leadership across a mix of global enterprises and fast-paced startups. I’ve worked with companies like Samsung, Adobe, GE Healthcare, and HPE — which gave me deep exposure to product development, architecture, and scaling platforms in both B2B and B2C environments.

I started my journey as a developer and gradually moved into roles like tech lead, architect, and senior technical product manager. This path helped me build a strong foundation in hands-on coding, backend systems, cloud platforms, and more recently, in AI/ML infrastructure and MLOps.

At HPE, I currently lead a team of product owners, bridging the gap between engineering and business. I work closely with cross-functional teams to define product roadmaps, manage technical debt, and enable faster delivery using agile and DevSecOps practices.

In my previous roles at GE Healthcare, I led the design and delivery of scalable microservices and AI inferencing pipelines using Kubernetes, Kafka, and Python. I also drove adoption of CI/CD and cloud-native architectures to improve system reliability and speed.

I enjoy building high-performing teams, mentoring engineers, and aligning technology with business outcomes. With my combined experience in engineering leadership and product strategy, I’m looking forward to contributing to a tech-driven, client-focused organization like J.P. Morgan."**
